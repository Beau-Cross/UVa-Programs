# UVa-Programs
These are UVa programming problems I solved in mid-late 2020.
I starred out my ID for obvious reasons, however I kept the problem's UVa ID so the prompt can be looked up.
All of these programs were judged by [onlinejudge.org](https://onlinejudge.org/).
Personally, I'm most proud of my solution for _Little Bishops_.
I would love to implement that kind of functionality into a chess bot.
